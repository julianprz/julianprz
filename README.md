My name is Julian Perez and I am an accountant(CPA) in sunny California. My 9-5 consists of auditing governmental agencies, helping individuals and businesses file their tax returns timely and accurate. 
I took a Computer Science class back in college as an elective and I remembered creating a simple website. I still remember the feeling and looking back at those files, it made me want to get into it again but this time I am going all in!

I hope to leave my accounting role and get hired as a JR developer in 2022. 
I am currently learning on Udemy, Freecodecamp, and Youtube.

Coding is not easy, but I enjoy the challenges!
